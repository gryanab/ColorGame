# ColorGame

This is a simple project based on 'The Great Color Game' introduced to me through a UDEMY Online Course on Web Development. 
It is build around HTML/CSS/JS. 

The Goal is to identify the correct color proposed in the title. It contains 2 different modes : Easy (3 blocks) and Hard (6 blocks).
